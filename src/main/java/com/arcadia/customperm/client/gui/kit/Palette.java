/**
 * Every colour the admin interface uses, named by role rather than by hue, as {@code 0xAARRGGBB}.
 * Screens and widgets never write a colour literal: a change of identity is a change of this file.
 *
 * <p>Identity: dark slate surfaces with an indigo accent. Backgrounds go from {@link #BG0} (window)
 * to {@link #BG3} (inputs, hovered rows), so a surface one step lighter always reads as "on top".
 * Status colours are reserved for meaning (allowed, warning, destructive) and never used as
 * decoration.
 *
 * <p>Pure Java, no Minecraft type, so the colour arithmetic is unit-tested.
